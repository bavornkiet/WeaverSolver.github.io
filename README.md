# WeaverSolver.github.io
The Breath-First Search (BFS) Weaver Solver project is a software application designed to find a path between two words, commonly known as "Weaver Words," using the Breadth-First Search algorithm. Weaver Words are pairs of words of the same length, where changing one letter at a time results in a valid word.
